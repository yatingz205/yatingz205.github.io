I am an intern at UNC Center for AIDS Research (Biostatistics Core). I am also a member of the Precision Health and AI Research Lab.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Biostatistics and in Mathematics at the University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill and graduated from Gillings School of Public Health with highest distinction in June 2022. My thesis, with Prof. Michael Kosorok being my thesis advisor, is titled “A Review of Causal Average Treatment Effect and Treatment Heterogeneity Estimation with Non-finite Action.”

I am interested in Precision Medicine, Causal Inference, Semi- and Non-parametric Statistics, and Statistical Learning, along with their applications in cancer, AIDS, chronic diseases, and more.
